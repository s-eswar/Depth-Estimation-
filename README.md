# Depth-Estimation-
Different code snippets using different variations of different stereo matching algorithms: Block Matching(BM), Semi-Global Block Matching, Graph cuts, Iterated conditional mode , Belief propagation, Tree weighted passing 

For Obstacle detection with toycar, we used [libuvc](https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc) tool for streaming data(images/video) from the [stero camera](https://leopardimaging.com/product/li-usb30-v024stereo/).
